Test:
Set an initial budget of $200
allow the player to bet in increments of $5 as the cards are drawn

If the player’s balance reaches $0, they lose and the game ends.

Test for splitt:
Create a method that allows the players to input their request to split their pair of cards.
Once split, the cards can be played separately as two separate hands.

Story: As a patreon at a virtual casino, I would like to have a full blackjack experience by being able to double down my cards during game play.
Test:
After a player is dealt their first two cards he may elect to "Double Down" if their two cards total a count of 9, 10, or 11.
When the player decides to "Double Down" they must double their initial bet.
After the bet is placed, a third and final card is dealt to the player, this is their hand for that round.
